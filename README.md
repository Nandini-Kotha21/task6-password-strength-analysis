Task 6 – Password Strength Analysis

Objective

The objective of this task is to evaluate the strength of different passwords using an online password strength checker. The analysis is based on parameters such as password length, variety of characters, presence of symbols, and avoidance of common patterns or repetitions.

Password Strength Table

| Password             | Score (%) | Complexity  | Strengths                                            | Weaknesses                                                          |
|----------------------|-----------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Password 1 (7 chars) | 30%       | Weak        | Contains lowercase letters and numbers               | Too short, lacks uppercase & symbols, consecutive lowercase letters |
| Password 2 (9 chars) | 64%       | Strong      | Has uppercase, lowercase, and numbers                | No symbols, consecutive lowercase letters                           |
| Password 3 (10 chars)| 100%      | Very Strong | Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, balanced mix | Slight consecutive lowercase letters                                |
| Password 4 (24 chars)| 91%       | Very Strong | Very long, lowercase + symbols, high complexity      | No uppercase, no numbers, many consecutive lowercase letters        |

Observations

1.Length greatly impacts score – longer passwords tend to be stronger.
2.Character variety (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) increases complexity.
3.Avoid repeated or sequential characters for better strength.
4.A strong password should be at least 12 characters long with a mix of all character types.

Conclusion

This analysis confirms that password security depends not just on length, but also on complexity. Adding multiple character types and avoiding predictable patterns leads to much stronger passwords.
